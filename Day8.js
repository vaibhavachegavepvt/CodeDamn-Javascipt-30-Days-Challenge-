// Leap
// Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

// The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

// on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
//   except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
//     unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
// For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap
// year, but 2000 is.



export const isLeap = (year) => {
	if ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || year % 400 == 0) {
		return true
	} else {
		return false
